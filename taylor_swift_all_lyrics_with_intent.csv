lyric,He said the way my blue eyes shined
lyric,Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
lyric,"I said, ""That's a lie"""
lyric,Just a boy in a Chevy truck
lyric,That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
lyric,On back roads at night
lyric,And I was right there beside him all summer long
lyric,And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone
lyric,But when you think Tim McGraw
lyric,I hope you think my favorite song
lyric,The one we danced to all night long
lyric,The moon like a spotlight on the lake
lyric,When you think happiness
lyric,I hope you think that little black dress
lyric,Think of my head on your chest
lyric,And my old faded blue jeans
lyric,When you think Tim McGraw
lyric,I hope you think of me
lyric,September saw a month of tears
lyric,And thankin' God that you weren't here
lyric,To see me like that
lyric,But in a box beneath my bed
lyric,Is a letter that you never read
lyric,From three summers back
lyric,It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
lyric,"And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe"
lyric,When you think Tim McGraw
lyric,I hope you think my favorite song
lyric,The one we danced to all night long
lyric,The moon like a spotlight on the lake
lyric,When you think happiness
lyric,I hope you think that little black dress
lyric,Think of my head on your chest
lyric,And my old faded blue jeans
lyric,When you think Tim McGraw

lyric,And I'm back for the first time since then
lyric,I'm standin' on your street
lyric,And there's a letter left on your doorstep
lyric,And the first thing that you'll read is:
lyric,"When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place"

lyric,I hope you think of me
lyric,"Oh, think of me"
lyric,Mmmm
lyric,He said the way my blue eyes shined
lyric,Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
lyric,"I said, ""That's a lie"""
lyric,"State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy"
lyric,I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
lyric,So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
lyric,That's fine I'll tell mine that you're gay!
lyric,By the way...
lyric,I hate that stupid old pickup truck
lyric,You never let me drive

lyric,So watch me strike a match
lyric,On all my wasted time
lyric,As far as I'm concerned
lyric,You're just another picture to burn!
lyric,There's no time for tears
lyric,I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
lyric,There's nothing stopping me
lyric,From going out with all of your best friends

lyric,Who's really bad at lying
lyric,So watch me strike a match
lyric,On all my wasted time
lyric,As far as I'm concerned
lyric,You're just another picture to burn!
lyric,And if you're missing me
lyric,You'd better keep it to yourself
lyric,Cause coming back around here
lyric,Would be bad for your health...
lyric,Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck
lyric,You never let me drive
lyric,You're a redneck heartbreak
lyric,Who's really bad at lying
lyric,So watch me strike a match

lyric,Drew looks at me
lyric,I fake a smile so he won't see
lyric,That I want and I'm needing
lyric,Everything that we should be
lyric,"I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about"
lyric,And she's got everything that I have to live without
lyric,Drew talks to me
lyric,I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
lyric,That I can't even see
lyric,Anyone when he's with me
lyric,"He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right"
lyric,I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night
lyric,He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
lyric,The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
lyric,He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do
lyric,Drew walks by me
lyric,Can he tell that I can't breathe?
lyric,"And there he goes, so perfectly"
lyric,The kind of flawless I wish I could be
lyric,"She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love"
lyric,Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause
lyric,He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
lyric,The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
lyric,He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do
lyric,"So, I drive home alone"
lyric,As I turn out the light
lyric,I'll put his picture down
lyric,And maybe get some sleep tonight
lyric,Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
lyric,The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
lyric,He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do
lyric,"He's the time taken up, but there's never enough"
lyric,And he's all that I need to fall into
lyric,Drew looks at me
lyric,I fake a smile so he won't see
lyric,"I don't know what I want, so don't ask me"
lyric,Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
lyric,"Don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking"
lyric,Trying to see through the rain coming down
lyric,Even though I'm not the only one
lyric,Who feels the way I do
lyric,"I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know"
lyric,"I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on"
lyric,"Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world"
lyric,"Got the radio on, my old blue jeans"
lyric,And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
lyric,"Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine"
lyric,Could you tell me what more do I need
lyric,"And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah"
lyric,But that's OK
lyric,"I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know"
lyric,"I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on"
lyric,"Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world"
lyric,Maybe I'm just a girl on a mission
lyric,But I'm ready to fly
lyric,"I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know"
lyric,"I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on"
lyric,"Oh I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know"
lyric,"Oh I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world"
lyric,Oh I'm just a girl
lyric,"Oh I'm just a girl, oh, oh"
lyric,Oh I'm just a girl
lyric,You have a way of coming easily to me
lyric,"And when you take, you take the very best of me"
lyric,So I start a fight 'cause I need to feel something
lyric,And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted
lyric,"Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day"
lyric,"Just walk away, ain't no use defending words that you will never say"
lyric,And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
lyric,I've never been anywhere cold as you
lyric,You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
lyric,And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
lyric,And you come away with a great little story
lyric,Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you
lyric,"Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day"
lyric,"So just walk away, ain't no use defending words that you will never say"
lyric,And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
lyric,I've never been anywhere cold as you
lyric,"You never did give a damn thing, honey, but I cried, cried for you"
lyric,"And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you, died for you"
lyric,"Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day"
lyric,Every smile you fake is so condescending counting all the scars you made
lyric,And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
lyric,I've never been anywhere cold as you
lyric,I didn't know what I would find
lyric,When I went looking for a reason
lyric,I know I didn't read between the lines
lyric,"And, baby, I've got nowhere to go"
lyric,I tried to take the road less traveled by
lyric,But nothing seems to work the first few times
lyric,Am I right?
lyric,So how can I ever try to be better?
lyric,Nobody ever lets me in
lyric,I can still see you
lyric,This ain't the best view
lyric,On the outside looking in
lyric,And I've been a lot of lonely places
lyric,I've never been on the outside
lyric,"You saw me there, but never knew"
lyric,That I would give it all up to be
lyric,"A part of this, a part of you"
lyric,And now it's all too late. So you see
lyric,You could've helped if you had wanted to
lyric,But no one notices until it's too late to do anything
lyric,So how can I ever try to be better?
lyric,Nobody ever lets me in
lyric,I can still see you
lyric,This ain't the best view
lyric,On the outside looking in
lyric,And I've been a lot of lonely places
lyric,I've never been on the outside
lyric,"Oh, yeah"
lyric,So how can I ever try to be better?
lyric,Nobody ever lets me in
lyric,And I can still see you
lyric,This ain't the best view
lyric,On the outside looking in
lyric,And I've been a lot of lonely places
lyric,I've never been on the outside
lyric,Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty
lyric,Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
lyric,You walk around here thinking you're not pretty
lyric,But that's not true 'cause I know you
lyric,"Hold on, baby, you're losing it"
lyric,"The water's high, you're jumping into it"
lyric,And letting go
lyric,And no one knows
lyric,"That you cry, but you don't tell anyone"
lyric,That you might not be the golden one
lyric,And you're tied together with a smile
lyric,But you're coming undone
lyric,I guess it's true that love was all you wanted
lyric,Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change
lyric,Hoping it will end up in his pocket
lyric,But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
lyric,"Oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay"
lyric,It's not his price to pay
lyric,"Hold on, baby, you're losing it"
lyric,"The water's high, you're jumping into it"
lyric,And letting go
lyric,And no one knows
lyric,"That you cry, but you don't tell anyone"
lyric,That you might not be the golden one
lyric,And you're tied together with a smile
lyric,But you're coming undone
lyric,"Hold on, baby, you're losing it"
lyric,"The water's high, you're jumping into it"
lyric,And letting go
lyric,And no one knows
lyric,"That you cry, but you don't tell anyone"
lyric,That you might not be the golden one
lyric,And you're tied together with a smile
lyric,But you're coming undone
lyric,You're tied together with a smile
lyric,But you're coming undone
lyric,"Goodbye, baby"
lyric,"With a smile, baby, baby"
lyric,Cory's eyes are like a jungle
lyric,"He smiles, it's like the radio"
lyric,He whispers songs into my window
lyric,In words that nobody knows
lyric,There's pretty girls on every corner
lyric,That watch him as he's walking home
lyric,"Saying, ""Does he know?"""
lyric,Will you ever know?
lyric,You're beautiful
lyric,Every little piece love
lyric,And don't you know
lyric,You're really gonna be someone
lyric,Ask anyone
lyric,And when you find everything you looked for
lyric,I hope your life leads you back to my door
lyric,"Oh, but if it don't"
lyric,Stay beautiful
lyric,Cory finds another way to be
lyric,The highlight of my day
lyric,I'm taking pictures in my mind
lyric,So I can save them for a rainy day
lyric,It's hard to make a conversation
lyric,When he's taking my breath away
lyric,"I should say, hey, by the way"
lyric,You're beautiful
lyric,Every little piece love
lyric,And don't you know
lyric,You're really gonna be someone
lyric,Ask anyone
lyric,And when you find everything you looked for
lyric,I hope your life leads you back to my door
lyric,"Oh, but if it don't"
lyric,Stay beautiful
lyric,If you and I are a story
lyric,That never gets told
lyric,If what you are is a daydream
lyric,I'll never get to hold
lyric,At least you'll know
lyric,You're beautiful
lyric,Every little piece love
lyric,And don't you know
lyric,You're really gonna be someone
lyric,Ask anyone
lyric,And when you find everything you looked for
lyric,I hope your life leads you back to my front door
lyric,"Oh, but if it don't"
lyric,Will you stay
lyric,"Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful"
lyric,"Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful?"
lyric,La la la
lyric,"Oh, oh, oh, oh"
lyric,"Oh, but if it don't"
lyric,Stay beautiful
lyric,Stay beautiful
lyric,"Na, na, na, na, na"
lyric,It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
lyric,"The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone"
lyric,Yesterday I found out about you
lyric,Even now just looking at you feels wrong
lyric,"You say that you'd take it all back, given one chance"
lyric,"It was a moment of weakness and you said, ""Yes."""
lyric,"You should've said ""No"", you should've gone home"
lyric,You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
lyric,You should've known that word
lyric,Bout what you did with her'd
lyric,Get back to me (get back to me).
lyric,And I should've been there in the back of your mind
lyric,"I shouldn't be asking myself, ""Why?"""
lyric,You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet...
lyric,"You should've said ""No"", baby, and you might still have me"
lyric,You can see that I've been crying
lyric,"And baby, you know all the right things to say"
lyric,But do you honestly expect me to believe
lyric,We could ever be the same?
lyric,"You say that the past is the past, you need one chance"
lyric,"It was a moment of weakness and you said, ""Yes."""
lyric,"You should've said ""No"", you should've gone home"
lyric,You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
lyric,You should've known that word
lyric,"Bout what you did with her'd,"
lyric,Get back to me (get back to me).
lyric,And I should've been there in the back of your mind
lyric,"I shouldn't be asking myself, ""Why?"""
lyric,You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet...
lyric,"You should've said ""No"", baby, and you might still have me"
lyric,I can't resist
lyric,"Before you go, tell me this:"
lyric,Was it worth it?
lyric,Was she worth this?
lyric,"No... no, no, no..."
lyric,"You should've said ""No"", you should've gone home"
lyric,You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
lyric,You should've known that word
lyric,"Bout what you did with her'd,"
lyric,Get back to me (get back to me).
lyric,And I should've been there in the back of your mind
lyric,"I shouldn't be asking myself, ""Why?"""
lyric,You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet...
lyric,"You should've said ""No"", baby, and you might still have me"
lyric,"She said, I was seven and you were nine"
lyric,I looked at you like the stars that shined
lyric,"In the sky, the pretty lights"
lyric,And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
lyric,Growing up and falling in love and our mamas smiled
lyric,"And rolled their eyes and said, ""Oh my, my, my"""
lyric,Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
lyric,"Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me"
lyric,"You never did, you never did"
lyric,Take me back when our world was one block wide
lyric,I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
lyric,"Just two kids, you and I"
lyric,"Oh my, my, my, my"
lyric,"Well, I was sixteen when suddenly"
lyric,I wasn't that little girl you used to see
lyric,But your eyes still shined like pretty lights
lyric,And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
lyric,They never believed we'd really fall in love
lyric,And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
lyric,"And said, ""Oh my, my, my"""
lyric,Take me back to the creek beds we turned up
lyric,"Two A.M. riding in your truck, and all I need is you next to me"
lyric,Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
lyric,The slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight
lyric,You stayed outside 'til the morning light
lyric,"Oh my, my, my, my"
lyric,A few years had gone and come around
lyric,We were sitting at our favorite spot in town
lyric,"And you looked at me, got down on one knee"
lyric,Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
lyric,Our whole town came and our mamas cried
lyric,"You said ""I do"" and I did too"
lyric,Take me home where we met so many years before
lyric,We'll rock our babies on that very front porch
lyric,"After all this time, you and I"
lyric,I'll be eighty-seven; you'll be eighty-nine
lyric,I'll still look at you like the stars that shine
lyric,"In the sky, oh my, my, my"
lyric,I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
lyric,In the front seat of his car
lyric,He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
lyric,The other on my heart
lyric,"I look around, turn the radio down"
lyric,"He says, ""Baby, is something wrong?"""
lyric,"I say, ""Nothin', I was just thinkin'"
lyric,"How we don't have a song"""
lyric,And he says
lyric,Our song is the slamming screen door
lyric,"Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window"
lyric,When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
lyric,Cause it's late and your mama don't know
lyric,Our song is the way you laugh
lyric,"The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"""
lyric,And when I got home 'fore I said amen
lyric,Asking God if he could play it again
lyric,I was walking up the front porch steps
lyric,After everything that day
lyric,Had gone all wrong or been trampled on
lyric,And lost and thrown away
lyric,"Got to the hallway, well on my way"
lyric,To my lovin' bed
lyric,I almost didn't notice all the roses
lyric,And the note that said
lyric,Our song is the slamming screen door
lyric,"Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window"
lyric,When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
lyric,Cause it's late and your mama don't know
lyric,Our song is the way you laugh
lyric,"The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"""
lyric,And when I got home 'fore I said amen
lyric,Asking God if he could play it again
lyric,Da-da-da-da
lyric,"I've heard every album, listened to the radio"
lyric,Waited for somethin' to come along
lyric,That was as good as our song
lyric,Cause our song is the slamming screen door
lyric,"Sneakin' out late, tappin' on his window"
lyric,When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
lyric,Cause it's late and his mama don't know
lyric,Our song is the way he laughs
lyric,"The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have"""
lyric,And when I got home 'fore I said amen
lyric,Asking God if he could play it again
lyric,"Play it again, oh, yeah"
lyric,"Oh, oh, yeah"
lyric,I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
lyric,In the front seat of his car
lyric,I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
lyric,And I wrote down our song
lyric,Friday night beneath the stars
lyric,In a field behind your yard
lyric,You and I are painting pictures in the sky
lyric,And sometimes we don't say a thing
lyric,Just listen to the crickets sing
lyric,Everything I need is right here by my side
lyric,And I know everything about you
lyric,I don't wanna live without you
lyric,I'm only up when you're not down
lyric,Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
lyric,It's like no matter what I do
lyric,"Well, you drive me crazy half the time"
lyric,"The other half, I'm only tryna"
lyric,Let you know that what I feel is true
lyric,And I'm only me when I'm with you
lyric,Just a small-town boy and girl
lyric,Living in a crazy world
lyric,Tryna figure out what is and isn't true
lyric,And I don't try to hide my tears
lyric,My secrets or my deepest fears
lyric,Through it all nobody gets me like you do
lyric,And you know everything about me
lyric,You say that you can't live without me
lyric,I'm only up when you're not down
lyric,Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
lyric,It's like no matter what I do
lyric,"Well, you drive me crazy half the time"
lyric,"The other half, I'm only tryna"
lyric,Let you know that what I feel is true
lyric,And I'm only me when I'm with you
lyric,When I'm with anybody else
lyric,It's so hard to be myself
lyric,And only you can tell
lyric,That I'm only up when you're not down
lyric,Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
lyric,It's like no matter what I do
lyric,"Well, you drive me crazy half the time"
lyric,"The other half, I'm only tryna"
lyric,Let you know that what I feel is true
lyric,"And I'm only me, who I wanna be"
lyric,"Well, I'm only me when I'm with you"
lyric,With you
lyric,"Uh-huh, yeah"
lyric,She can't see the way your eyes
lyric,Light up when you smile
lyric,She'll never notice how you stop and stare
lyric,Whenever she walks by
lyric,And you can't see me wanting you the way you want her
lyric,But you are everything to me
lyric,And I just wanna show you
lyric,She don't even know you
lyric,She's never gonna love you like I want to
lyric,And you just see right through me
lyric,But if you only knew me
lyric,We could be a beautiful
lyric,Miracle
lyric,Unbelievable
lyric,Instead of just invisible
lyric,"Oh, yeah"
lyric,There's a fire inside of you
lyric,That can't help but shine through
lyric,She's never gonna see the light
lyric,No matter what you do
lyric,And all I think about is how to make you think of me
lyric,And everything that we could be
lyric,I just wanna show you
lyric,She don't even know you
lyric,She's never gonna love you like I want to
lyric,And you just see right through me
lyric,If you only knew me
lyric,We could be a beautiful
lyric,Miracle
lyric,Unbelievable
lyric,Instead of just invisible
lyric,Like shadows in a faded light
lyric,"Oh, we're invisible"
lyric,I just wanna open your eyes
lyric,And make you realize
lyric,I just wanna show you
lyric,She don't even know you
lyric,"Baby, let me love you"
lyric,Let me want you
lyric,You just see right through me
lyric,But if you only knew me
lyric,We could be a beautiful
lyric,Miracle
lyric,Unbelievable
lyric,Instead of just invisible
lyric,"Oh, yeah"
lyric,She can't see the way your eyes
lyric,Light up when you smile
lyric,Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
lyric,"Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?"
lyric,Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
lyric,Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
lyric,Maybe I should've seen the signs
lyric,Should've read the writing on the wall
lyric,And realized by the distance in your eyes that I would be the one to fall
lyric,"No matter what you say, I still can't believe"
lyric,That you would walk away
lyric,"It don't make sense to me, but"
lyric,Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
lyric,"Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?"
lyric,Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
lyric,Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
lyric,It's not unbroken anymore
lyric,How do I get it back the way it was before?
lyric,Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
lyric,"Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?"
lyric,Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
lyric,Why would you wanna break? Why would you wanna break it?
lyric,Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
lyric,"Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?"
lyric,Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
lyric,Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?

lyric,Don't know why I do
lyric,So I drive home alone
lyric,As I turn out the light
lyric,I'll put his picture down
lyric,And maybe get some sleep tonight
lyric,Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
lyric,The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
lyric,He's the song in the car I keep singing
lyric,Don't know why I do
lyric,"He's the time taken up, but there's never enough"
lyric,And he's all that I need to fall into
lyric,Drew looks at me
lyric,I fake a smile so he won't see
lyric,I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
lyric,Busy streets and busy lives
lyric,And all we know is touch and go
lyric,We are alone with our changing minds
lyric,We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds
lyric,Or fades in time
lyric,And I never (Never)
lyric,Saw you coming
lyric,And I’ll never (Never)
lyric,Be the same
lyric,You come around and the armor falls
lyric,Pierce the room like a cannonball
lyric,Now all we know is don’t let go
lyric,"We are alone, just you and me"
lyric,Up in your room and our slates are clean
lyric,"Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes"
lyric,So you were never a saint
lyric,And I've loved in shades of wrong
lyric,We learn to live with the pain
lyric,Mosaic broken hearts
lyric,But this love is brave and wild
lyric,And I never (Never)
lyric,Saw you coming
lyric,And I’ll never (Never)
lyric,Be the same
lyric,This is a state of grace
lyric,This is the worthwhile fight
lyric,Love is a ruthless game
lyric,Unless you play it good and right
lyric,These are the hands of fate
lyric,You’re my Achilles heel
lyric,This is the golden age
lyric,Of something good and right and real
lyric,And I never (Never)
lyric,Saw you coming
lyric,And I’ll never
lyric,Be the same
lyric,And I never (Never)
lyric,Saw you coming
lyric,And I’ll never (So you were never a saint)

lyric,(But this love is brave and wild)
lyric,This is a state of grace
lyric,This is the worthwhile fight
lyric,Love is a ruthless game
lyric,Unless you play it good and right
lyric,Loving him is like
lyric,Driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
lyric,"Faster than the wind, passionate as sin"
lyric,Ending so suddenly
lyric,Loving him is like trying to change your mind
lyric,Once you're already flying through the free fall
lyric,"Like the colors in autumn, so bright"
lyric,Just before they lose it all
lyric,Losing him was blue like I'd never known
lyric,"Missing him was dark gray, all alone"
lyric,Forgetting him was like
lyric,Trying to know somebody you never met
lyric,But loving him was red
lyric,"(Red, red)"
lyric,"(Red, red)"
lyric,Loving him was red
lyric,"(Red, red)"
lyric,"(Red, red)"
lyric,Touching him was like
lyric,Realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
lyric,Memorizing him was as
lyric,Easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
lyric,Fighting with him was like
lyric,Trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
lyric,Regretting him was like
lyric,Wishing you never found out that love could be that strong
lyric,Losing him was blue like I'd never known
lyric,"Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Whoa)"
lyric,Forgetting him was like
lyric,Trying to know somebody you never met
lyric,But loving him was red
lyric,"(Red, red)"
lyric,"Oh, red (Red, red)"
lyric,"Burning red (Red, red)"
lyric,"(Red, red)"
lyric,Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
lyric,"Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go"
lyric,But moving on from him is impossible
lyric,When I still see it all in my head
lyric,In burning red
lyric,"Burning, it was red"
lyric,"Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known"
lyric,"Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Whoa)"
lyric,Forgetting him was like
lyric,Trying to know somebody you never met
lyric,Cause loving him was red

lyric,"Burning red (Red, red)"
lyric,"(Red, red)"
lyric,"And that's why (Red, red) he's spinning 'round in my head"
lyric,"Comes back to me (Red, red), burning red"
lyric,"(Red, red) Yeah, yeah"
lyric,"(Red, red)"
lyric,His love was like
lyric,Driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
lyric,Put your lips close to mine
lyric,As long as they don't touch
lyric,"Out of focus, eye to eye"
lyric,Til the gravity's too much
lyric,And I'll do anything you say
lyric,If you say it with your hands
lyric,And I'd be smart to walk away
lyric,But you're quicksand
lyric,This slope is treacherous
lyric,This path is reckless
lyric,This slope is treacherous
lyric,And I-I-I like it
lyric,I can't decide if it's a choice
lyric,Getting swept away
lyric,I hear the sound of my own voice
lyric,Asking you to stay
lyric,And all we are is skin and bone
lyric,Trained to get along
lyric,Forever going with the flow
lyric,But you're friction
lyric,[Chorus]
lyric,This slope is treacherous
lyric,This path is reckless
lyric,This slope is treacherous
lyric,"I, I, I like it"
lyric,Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
lyric,"And I will get you, get you alone"
lyric,Your name has echoed through my mind
lyric,"And I just think you should, think you should know"
lyric,That nothing safe is worth the drive
lyric,"And I would follow you, follow you home"
lyric,"I'll follow you, follow you home"
lyric,This hope is treacherous
lyric,This daydream is dangerous
lyric,This hope is treacherous
lyric,"I-I-I, I-I-I, I-I-I"
lyric,Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
lyric,"And I will get you, get you alone"
lyric,Your name has echoed through my mind
lyric,"And I just think you should, think you should know"

lyric,"And I would follow you, follow you home"
lyric,"I'll follow you, follow you home"
lyric,"I'll follow you, follow you home"
lyric,"I'll follow you, follow you home"
lyric,This slope is treacherous
lyric,I-I-I like it
lyric,"Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago"
lyric,"I was in your sights, you got me alone"
lyric,"You found me, you found me, you found me"
lyric,"I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that"
lyric,"And when I fell hard, you took a step back"
lyric,"Without me, without me, without me"
lyric,And he's long gone when he's next to me
lyric,And I realize the blame is on me
lyric,Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
lyric,So shame on me now
lyric,Flew me to places I'd never been
lyric,"Til you put me down, oh"
lyric,I knew you were trouble when you walked in
lyric,So shame on me now
lyric,Flew me to places I'd never been
lyric,Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
lyric,"Oh, oh-oh"
lyric,"Trouble, trouble, trouble"
lyric,"Oh, oh-oh"
lyric,"Trouble, trouble, trouble"
lyric,"No apologies, he'll never see you cry"
lyric,Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
lyric,"You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning"
lyric,And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
lyric,A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
lyric,"And now I see, now I see, now I see"
lyric,He was long gone when he met me
lyric,"And I realize the joke is on me, hey"
lyric,I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Oh)
lyric,So shame on me now
lyric,Flew me to places I'd never been
lyric,"Til you put me down, oh"

lyric,And the saddest fear
lyric,Comes creeping in
lyric,That you never loved me
lyric,"Or her, or anyone, or anything"
lyric,Yeah
lyric,I knew you were trouble when you walked in
lyric,So shame on me now
lyric,Flew me to places I'd never been (Never been)
lyric,"Til you put me down, oh"
lyric,I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Knew it right there)
lyric,So shame on me now (Knew it right there)
lyric,Flew me to places I'd never been (Ooh)

lyric,"Trouble, trouble, trouble"
lyric,I knew you were trouble when you walked in
lyric,"Trouble, trouble, trouble"
lyric,"I walked through the door with you, the air was cold"
lyric,But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
lyric,And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
lyric,"And you've still got it in your drawer, even now"
lyric,"Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze"
lyric,"We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate"
lyric,Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
lyric,And I can picture it after all these days
lyric,And I know it's long gone and
lyric,That magic's not here no more
lyric,"And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all"
lyric,"Oh, oh, oh"
lyric,Cause there we are again on that little town street
lyric,You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
lyric,"Wind in my hair, I was there"
lyric,I remember it all too well
lyric,"Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red"
lyric,You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
lyric,And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
lyric,"You tell me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me"
lyric,And I know it's long gone and
lyric,There was nothing else I could do
lyric,And I forget about you long enough
lyric,To forget why I needed to
lyric,Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
lyric,We're dancing ‘round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
lyric,"Down the stairs, I was there"
lyric,"I remember it all too well, yeah"
lyric,Maybe we got lost in translation
lyric,Maybe I asked for too much
lyric,But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
lyric,Til you tore it all up
lyric,"Running scared, I was there"
lyric,I remember it all too well
lyric,And you call me up again
lyric,Just to break me like a promise
lyric,So casually cruel in the name of being honest
lyric,I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
lyric,"Cause I remember it all, all, all"
lyric,Too well
lyric,"Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it"
lyric,"I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it"
lyric,After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
lyric,Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
lyric,But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
lyric,Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
lyric,You can't get rid of it
lyric,"Cause you remember it all too well, yeah"
lyric,Cause there we are again when I loved you so
lyric,Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
lyric,"It was rare, I was there"
lyric,I remember it all too well
lyric,"Wind in my hair, you were there"
lyric,You remember it all
lyric,"Down the stairs, you were there"
lyric,You remember it all
lyric,"It was rare, I was there"
lyric,I remember it all too well
lyric,It feels like a perfect night
lyric,To dress up like hipsters
lyric,"And make fun of our exes, uh-uh, uh-uh"
lyric,It feels like a perfect night
lyric,For breakfast at midnight
lyric,"To fall in love with strangers, uh-uh, uh-uh"
lyric,Yeah
lyric,"We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time"
lyric,"It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah"
lyric,Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
lyric,"It's time, oh-oh"
lyric,"I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22"
lyric,Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
lyric,"You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to"
lyric,Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're
lyric,"22, 22"
lyric,It seems like one of those nights
lyric,This place is too crowded
lyric,"Too many cool kids, uh-uh, uh-uh"

lyric,Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme
lyric,"Took off faster than a green light, go"

lyric,"So many signs, so many signs"
lyric,You didn't even see the signs
lyric,I think I've seen this film before
lyric,And I didn't like the ending
lyric,You're not my homeland anymore
lyric,So what am I defending now?
lyric,"You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out"
lyric,I think I've seen this film before
lyric,So I'm leavin' out the side door

lyric,"We gather here, we line up, weepin' in a sunlit room"
lyric,"And if I'm on fire, you'll be made of ashes, too"
lyric,"Even on my worst day, did I deserve, babe"
lyric,All the hell you gave me?
lyric,"Cause I loved you, I swear I loved you"
lyric,Til my dying day
lyric,I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
lyric,"And you're the hero flying around, saving face"
lyric,"And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?"
lyric,"Cursing my name, wishing I stayed"
lyric,Look at how my tears ricochet
lyric,"We gather stones, never knowing what they'll mean"
lyric,"Some to throw, some to make a diamond ring"
lyric,You know I didn't want to have to haunt you
lyric,But what a ghostly scene
lyric,You wear the same jewels that I gave you
lyric,As you bury me
lyric,I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
lyric,"Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave"
lyric,"And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?"
lyric,"Cursing my name, wishing I stayed"
lyric,Look at how my tears ricochet
lyric,And I can go anywhere I want
lyric,"Anywhere I want, just not home"
lyric,"And you can aim for my heart, go for blood"
lyric,But you would still miss me in your bones
lyric,And I still talk to you (When I'm screaming at the sky)
lyric,And when you can't sleep at night (You hear my stolen lullabies)
lyric,I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
lyric,And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
lyric,"You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same"
lyric,"Cursing my name, wishing I stayed"
lyric,You turned into your worst fears
lyric,"And you're tossing out blame, drunk on this pain"
lyric,Crossing out the good years
lyric,"And you're cursing my name, wishing I stayed"
lyric,Look at how my tears ricochet
lyric,I want you to know
lyric,I'm a mirrorball
lyric,I'll show you every version of yourself tonight
lyric,I'll get you out on the floor
lyric,Shimmering beautiful

lyric,When they sent home the horses and the rodeo clowns
lyric,I'm still on that tightrope
lyric,I'm still trying everything to get you laughing at me
lyric,"And I'm still a believer, but I don't know why"

lyric,Please picture me in the trees
lyric,I hit my peak at seven
lyric,Feet in the swing over the creek
lyric,I was too scared to jump in
lyric,"But I, I was high in the sky"
lyric,With Pennsylvania under me
lyric,Are there still beautiful things?
lyric,Sweet tea in the summer
lyric,"Cross your heart, won't tell no other"
lyric,And though I can’t recall your face
lyric,I still got love for you
lyric,Your braids like a pattern
lyric,Love you to the Moon and to Saturn
lyric,Passed down like folk songs
lyric,The love lasts so long
lyric,And I've been meaning to tell you
lyric,I think your house is haunted
lyric,Your dad is always mad and that must be why
lyric,And I think you should come live with me
lyric,And we can be pirates
lyric,Then you won't have to cry
lyric,Or hide in the closet
lyric,And just like a folk song
lyric,Our love will be passed on
lyric,Please picture me in the weeds
lyric,Before I learned civility
lyric,I used to scream ferociously
lyric,Any time I wanted
lyric,"I, I"
lyric,Sweet tea in the summer
lyric,"Cross my heart, won’t tell no other"
lyric,And though I can't recall your face
lyric,I still got love for you
lyric,Pack your dolls and a sweater
lyric,We'll move to India forever
lyric,Passed down like folk songs
lyric,Our love lasts so long
lyric,"Salt air, and the rust on your door"
lyric,I never needed anything more
lyric,"Whispers of ""Are you sure?"""
lyric,Never have I ever before
lyric,But I can see us lost in the memory
lyric,August slipped away into a moment in time
lyric,Cause it was never mine
lyric,And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
lyric,August sipped away like a bottle of wine
lyric,Cause you were never mine
lyric,Your back beneath the sun
lyric,Wishin' I could write my name on it
lyric,Will you call when you're back at school?
lyric,I remember thinkin' I had you
lyric,But I can see us lost in the memory
lyric,August slipped away into a moment in time
lyric,Cause it was never mine
lyric,And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
lyric,August sipped away like a bottle of wine
lyric,Cause you were never mine
lyric,Back when we were still changin' for the better
lyric,Wanting was enough
lyric,"For me, it was enough"
lyric,To live for the hope of it all
lyric,Cancel plans just in case you'd call
lyric,"And say, ""Meet me behind the mall"""
lyric,"So much for summer love and saying ""us"""
lyric,Cause you weren't mine to lose
lyric,"You weren't mine to lose, no"
lyric,But I can see us lost in the memory
lyric,August slipped away into a moment in time
lyric,Cause it was never mine
lyric,And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
lyric,August sipped away like a bottle of wine
lyric,Cause you were never mine
lyric,Cause you were never mine
lyric,Never mine
lyric,But do you remember?
lyric,"Remember when I pulled up and said ""Get in the car"""
lyric,And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
lyric,"Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all"
lyric,Meet me behind the mall

lyric,"(For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)"
lyric,I've been having a hard time adjusting
lyric,"I had the shiniest wheels, now they're rusting"
lyric,I didn't know if you'd care if I came back
lyric,I have a lot of regrets about that
lyric,Pulled the car off the road to the lookout
lyric,Could've followed my fears all the way down
lyric,And maybe I don't quite know what to say
lyric,But I'm here in your doorway
lyric,I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
lyric,I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
lyric,They told me all of my cages were mental
lyric,So I got wasted like all my potential
lyric,And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad
lyric,I have a lot of regrets about that
lyric,"I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere"
lyric,Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here
lyric,Pouring out my heart to a stranger
lyric,But I didn't pour the whiskey
lyric,I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
lyric,I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
lyric,[Post-Chorus]
lyric,At least I'm trying
lyric,And it's hard to be at a party when I feel like an open wound
lyric,It's hard to be anywhere these days when all I want is you
lyric,You're a flashback in a film reel on the one screen in my town
lyric,And I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
lyric,(And maybe I don't quite know what to say)
lyric,I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
lyric,At least I'm trying
lyric,Make sure nobody sees you leave
lyric,"Hood over your head, keep your eyes down"
lyric,Tell your friends you're out for a run
lyric,You’ll be flushed when you return
lyric,Take the road less traveled by
lyric,Tell yourself you can always stop
lyric,What started in beautiful rooms
lyric,Ends with meetings in parking lots
lyric,And that's the thing about illicit affairs
lyric,And clandestine meetings and longing stares
lyric,It's born from just one single glance
lyric,But it dies and it dies and it dies
lyric,A million little times
lyric,Leave the perfume on the shelf
lyric,That you picked out just for him
lyric,So you leave no trace behind
lyric,Like you don’t even exist
lyric,Take the words for what they are
lyric,"A dwindling, mercurial high"
lyric,A drug that only worked
lyric,The first few hundred times
lyric,And that's the thing about illicit affairs
lyric,And clandestine meetings and stolen stares
lyric,They show their truth one single time
lyric,But they lie and they lie and they lie
lyric,A million little times
lyric,And you wanna scream
lyric,"Don't call me ""kid,"" don't call me ""baby"""
lyric,Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me
lyric,You showed me colors you know I can't see with anyone else
lyric,"Don't call me ""kid,"" don't call me ""baby"""
lyric,Look at this idiotic fool that you made me
lyric,You taught me a secret language I can't speak with anyone else
lyric,And you know damn well
lyric,"For you, I would ruin myself"
lyric,A million little times
lyric,Green was the color of the grass
lyric,Where I used to read at Centennial Park
lyric,I used to think I would meet somebody there
lyric,Teal was the color of your shirt
lyric,When you were sixteen at the yogurt shop
lyric,You used to work at to make a little money
lyric,"Time, curious time"
lyric,"Gave me no compasses, gave me no signs"
lyric,Were there clues I didn't see?
lyric,And isn't it just so pretty to think
lyric,All along there was some
lyric,Invisible string
lyric,Tying you to me?
lyric,Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
lyric,Bad was the blood of the song in the cab
lyric,On your first trip to LA
lyric,You ate at my favorite spot for dinner
lyric,Bold was the waitress on our three-year trip
lyric,Getting lunch down by the Lakes
lyric,She said I looked like an American singer
lyric,"Time, mystical time"
lyric,"Cutting me open, then healing me fine"
lyric,Were there clues I didn't see?
lyric,And isn't it just so pretty to think
lyric,All along there was some
lyric,Invisible string
lyric,Tying you to me?
lyric,Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
lyric,A string that pulled me
lyric,"Out of all the wrong arms, right into that dive bar"
lyric,Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
lyric,Chains around my demons
lyric,Wool to brave the seasons
lyric,One single thread of gold
lyric,Tied me to you
lyric,Cold was the steel of my axe to grind
lyric,For the boys who broke my heart
lyric,Now I send their babies presents
lyric,Gold was the color of the leaves
lyric,When I showed you around Centennial Park
lyric,Hell was the journey but it brought me heaven
lyric,"Time, wondrous time"
lyric,Gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies
lyric,And it's cool
lyric,"Baby, with me"
lyric,And isn't it just so pretty to think
lyric,All along there was some
lyric,Invisible string
lyric,Tying you to me?
lyric,Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
lyric,Me
lyric,Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
lyric,(Ah-ah-ah)
lyric,(Ah-ah-ah)
lyric,What did you think I'd say to that?
lyric,Does a scorpion sting when fighting back?
lyric,"They strike to kill, and you know I will"
lyric,You know I will
lyric,What do you sing on your drive home?
lyric,Do you see my face in the neighbor's lawn?
lyric,Does she smile?
lyric,"Or does she mouth, ""Fuck you forever""?"
lyric,"Every time you call me crazy, I get more crazy"
lyric,What about that?
lyric,"And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry"
lyric,And there's nothing like a mad woman
lyric,What a shame she went mad
lyric,No one likes a mad woman
lyric,You made her like that
lyric,And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
lyric,And you find something to wrap your noose around
lyric,And there's nothing like a mad woman
lyric,Now I breathe flames each time I talk
lyric,My cannons all firin' at your yacht
lyric,"They say ""move on,"" but you know I won't"
lyric,And women like hunting witches too
lyric,Doing your dirtiest work for you
lyric,It's obvious that wanting me dead
lyric,Has really brought you two together
lyric,"Every time you call me crazy, I get more crazy"
lyric,What about that?
lyric,"And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry"
lyric,And there's nothing like a mad woman
lyric,What a shame she went mad
lyric,No one likes a mad woman
lyric,You made her like that
lyric,And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
lyric,And you find something to wrap your noose around
lyric,And there's nothing like a mad woman
lyric,"I'm taking my time, taking my time"
lyric,Cause you took everything from me
lyric,"Watching you climb, watching you climb"
lyric,Over people like me
lyric,The master of spin has a couple side flings
lyric,Good wives always know
lyric,"She should be mad, should be scathing like me, but"
lyric,No one likes a mad woman
lyric,What a shame she went mad
lyric,You made her like that
lyric,"Keep your helmet, keep your life, son"
lyric,"Just a flesh wound, here's your rifle"
lyric,Crawling up the beaches now
lyric,"Sir, I think he's bleeding out"
lyric,And some things you just can't speak about
lyric,"With you I serve, with you I fall down, down"
lyric,"Watch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out"
lyric,Something med school did not cover
lyric,"Someone's daughter, someone's mother"
lyric,Holds your hand through plastic now
lyric,"Doc, I think she's crashing out"
lyric,And some things you just can't speak about
lyric,Only twenty minutes to sleep
lyric,But you dream of some epiphany
lyric,Just one single glimpse of relief
lyric,To make some sense of what you've seen
lyric,"With you I serve, with you I fall down, down (Down)"
lyric,"Watch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out"

lyric,Just one single glimpse of relief
lyric,To make some sense of what you've seen
lyric,"Betty, I won't make assumptions"
lyric,"About why you switched your homeroom, but"
lyric,I think it's 'cause of me
lyric,"Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard"
lyric,When I passed your house
lyric,It's like I couldn't breathe
lyric,You heard the rumors from Inez
lyric,You can't believe a word she says
lyric,"Most times, but this time it was true"
lyric,The worst thing that I ever did
lyric,Was what I did to you
lyric,But if I just showed up at your party
lyric,Would you have me? Would you want me?
lyric,Would you tell me to go fuck myself
lyric,Or lead me to the garden?
lyric,"In the garden, would you trust me"
lyric,If I told you it was just a summer thing?
lyric,"I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything"
lyric,But I know I miss you
lyric,"Betty, I know where it all went wrong"
lyric,Your favorite song was playing
lyric,From the far side of the gym
lyric,I was nowhere to be found
lyric,"I hate the crowds, you know that"
lyric,"Plus, I saw you dance with him"
lyric,You heard the rumors from Inez
lyric,You can't believe a word she says
lyric,"Most times, but this time it was true"
lyric,The worst thing that I ever did
lyric,Was what I did to you
lyric,But if I just showed up at your party

lyric,If I told you it was just a summer thing?
lyric,"I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything"
lyric,But I know I miss you
lyric,I was walking home on broken cobblestones
lyric,Just thinking of you when she pulled up like
lyric,A figment of my worst intentions
lyric,"She said ""James, get in, let's drive"""
lyric,Those days turned into nights
lyric,"Slept next to her, but"
lyric,I dreamt of you all summer long
lyric,"Betty, I'm here on your doorstep"
lyric,And I planned it out for weeks now
lyric,But it's finally sinkin' in
lyric,"Betty, right now is the last time"
lyric,I can dream about what happens when
lyric,You see my face again
lyric,The only thing I wanna do
lyric,Is make it up to you
lyric,So I showed up at your party
lyric,"Yeah, I showed up at your party"
lyric,"Yeah, I showed up at your party"
lyric,Will you have me? Will you love me?
lyric,Will you kiss me on the porch
lyric,In front of all your stupid friends?
lyric,"If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?"
lyric,Will it patch your broken wings?
lyric,"I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything"
lyric,But I know I miss you
lyric,Standing in your cardigan
lyric,Kissin' in my car again
lyric,Stopped at a streetlight
lyric,You know I miss you
lyric,Our coming-of-age has come and gone
lyric,"Suddenly this summer, it's clear"
lyric,I never had the courage of my convictions
lyric,As long as danger is near
lyric,"And it's just around the corner, darlin'"
lyric,Cause it lives in me
lyric,"No, I could never give you peace"
lyric,But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
lyric,"If your cascade, ocean wave blues come"
lyric,All these people think love's for show
lyric,But I would die for you in secret
lyric,"The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me"
lyric,Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
lyric,Your integrity makes me seem small
lyric,You paint dreamscapes on the wall
lyric,"I talk shit with my friends, it's like I'm wasting your honor"
lyric,And you know that I'd swing with you for the fences
lyric,Sit with you in the trenches
lyric,"Give you my wild, give you a child"
lyric,Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other
lyric,"Family that I chose, now that I see your brother as my brother"
lyric,Is it enough?
lyric,"But there's robbers to the east, clowns to the west"
lyric,"I'd give you my sunshine, give you my best"
lyric,But the rain is always gonna come if you're standin' with me
lyric,But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
lyric,"If your cascade, ocean wave blues come"

lyric,Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
lyric,Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
lyric,My only one
lyric,My smoking gun
lyric,My eclipsed sun
lyric,This has broken me down
lyric,My twisted knife
lyric,My sleepless night
lyric,My winless fight
lyric,This has frozen my ground
lyric,"Stood on the cliffside screaming, ""Give me a reason"""
lyric,Your faithless love's the only hoax I believe in
lyric,Don't want no other shade of blue but you
lyric,No other sadness in the world would do
lyric,My best laid plan
lyric,Your sleight of hand
lyric,My barren land
lyric,I am ash from your fire
lyric,"Stood on the cliffside screaming, ""Give me a reason"""
lyric,Your faithless love's the only hoax I believe in
lyric,Don't want no other shade of blue but you
lyric,No other sadness in the world would do
lyric,You know I left a part of me back in New York
lyric,You knew the hero died so what's the movie for?
lyric,You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
lyric,From when they pulled me apart
lyric,You knew the password so I let you in the door
lyric,You knew you won so what's the point of keeping score?
lyric,You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
lyric,From when they pulled me apart
lyric,But what you did was just as dark
lyric,"(Ah, ah, ah)"
lyric,"Darling, this was just as hard"
lyric,As when they pulled me apart
lyric,My only one
lyric,My kingdom come undone
lyric,My broken drum
lyric,You have beaten my heart
lyric,Don't want no other shade of blue but you
lyric,No other sadness in the world would do
lyric,Is it romantic how all my elegies eulogize me?
lyric,I'm not cut out for all these cynical clones
lyric,These hunters with cell phones
lyric,Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
lyric,"I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you"
lyric,Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
lyric,"I'm setting off, but not without my muse"
lyric,What should be over burrowed under my skin
lyric,In heart-stopping waves of hurt
lyric,I've come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze
lyric,Tell me what are my words worth
lyric,Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
lyric,"I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you"
lyric,Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
lyric,"I'm setting off, but not without my muse"
lyric,I want auroras and sad prose
lyric,I want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet
lyric,Cause I haven't moved in years
lyric,And I want you right here
lyric,A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground
lyric,With no one around to tweet it
lyric,While I bathe in cliffside pools
lyric,With my calamitous love and insurmountable grief
lyric,Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
lyric,"I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you"
lyric,Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
lyric,"I'm setting off, but not without my muse"
lyric,"No, not without you"
lyric,How many days did I spend thinking
lyric,"Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?"
lyric,Lived in the shade you were throwing
lyric,"Til all of my sunshine was gone, gone, gone"
lyric,And I couldn't get away from ya
lyric,"In my feelings more than Drake, so yeah"
lyric,"Your name on my lips, tongue-tied"
lyric,"Free rent, living in my mind"
lyric,But then something happened one magical night
lyric,I forgot that you existed
lyric,"And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't"
lyric,And it was so nice
lyric,So peaceful and quiet
lyric,I forgot that you existed
lyric,"It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference"
lyric,I forgot that you
lyric,Got out some popcorn
lyric,"As soon as my rep started going down, down, down"
lyric,Laughed on the school yard
lyric,"As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground"
lyric,And I would've stuck around for ya
lyric,"Would've fought the whole town, so yeah"
lyric,"Would've been right there, front row"
lyric,Even if nobody came to your show
lyric,"But you showed who you are, then one magical night"
lyric,I forgot that you existed
lyric,"And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't"
lyric,And it was so nice
lyric,So peaceful and quiet
lyric,I forgot that you existed
lyric,"It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference"

lyric,Try and stay out of everybody's way
lyric,It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
lyric,For the next four years in this town

lyric,And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
lyric,And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
lyric,When the night ends
lyric,Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
lyric,You're gonna believe them
lyric,And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
lyric,"Makes your head spin around, well"

lyric,I didn't know it at fifteen
lyric,When all you wanted was to be wanted
lyric,Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
lyric,"Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday"

lyric,And Abigail gave everything she had
lyric,To a boy who changed his mind
lyric,And we both cried
lyric,Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
lyric,You're gonna believe them
lyric,"And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall"
lyric,But I've found time can heal most anything
lyric,And you just might find who you're supposed to be
lyric,I didn't know who I was supposed to be
lyric,At fifteen
lyric,"La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la"

lyric,On a balcony in summer air
lyric,"See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns"
lyric,See you make your way through the crowd
lyric,"And say, ""Hello"""
lyric,Little did I know
lyric,"That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles"
lyric,"And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet"""
lyric,And I was crying on the staircase
lyric,"Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said"

lyric,"I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run"
lyric,You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
lyric,"It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes"""
lyric,So I sneak out to the garden to see you
lyric,We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
lyric,So close your eyes
lyric,"Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh"
lyric,"Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter"
lyric,"And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet"""
lyric,But you were everything to me
lyric,"I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said"
lyric,"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone"
lyric,"I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run"
lyric,You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
lyric,"It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes"""
lyric,"Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel"
lyric,"This love is difficult, but it's real"
lyric,"Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess"
lyric,"It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes"""
lyric,"Oh, oh"
lyric,And I got tired of waiting
lyric,Wondering if you were ever coming around
lyric,My faith in you was fading
lyric,When I met you on the outskirts of town
lyric,"And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone"
lyric,"I keep waiting for you, but you never come"
lyric,"Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"""
lyric,"He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said"
lyric,"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'"

lyric,Were you just kidding?
lyric,Cause it seems to me
lyric,"This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak"
lyric,I don't feel welcome anymore
lyric,"Baby, what happened? Please tell me"
lyric,Cause one second it was perfect
lyric,Now you're halfway out the door
lyric,"And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called"
lyric,And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
lyric,"And you flashback to when he said, ""forever and always"""
lyric,"Oh, and it rains in your bedroom"

lyric,"Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure"
lyric,So here's to everything coming down to nothing
lyric,Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
lyric,Where is this going?
lyric,"Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore"
lyric,"And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called"
lyric,And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all

lyric,"I'm five years old, it's getting cold, I've got my big coat on"
lyric,"I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run"
lyric,Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
lyric,"Look now, the sky is gold"
lyric,I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home
lyric,I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
lyric,But I know you're not scared of anything at all
lyric,Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
lyric,But I know I had the best day with you today
lyric,I'm thirteen now
lyric,And don't know how my friends could be so mean
lyric,I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
lyric,And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
lyric,And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names
lyric,I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school
lyric,But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
lyric,Don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay
lyric,But I know I had the best day with you today
lyric,"I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger"
lyric,"God smiles on my little brother, inside and out"
lyric,He's better than I am
lyric,I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
lyric,And I had the best days with you
lyric,There is a video I found from back when I was three
lyric,You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me
lyric,It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarves
lyric,Daddy's smart
lyric,And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world
lyric,Now I know why all the trees change in the fall
lyric,I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
lyric,And I love you for giving me your eyes
lyric,For staying back and watching me shine
lyric,"And I didn't know if you knew, so I'm taking this chance to say"
lyric,That I had the best day with you today
lyric,"Well, it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you"
lyric,Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
lyric,"You know it’s all the same, another time and place"
lyric,Repeating history and you're getting sick of it
lyric,But I believe in whatever you do
lyric,And I'll do anything to see it through
lyric,Because these things will change
lyric,Can you feel it now?
lyric,These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
lyric,"This revolution, the time will come"
lyric,For us to finally win
lyric,"And we’ll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah"
lyric,"Oh, oh"
lyric,"So we've been outnumbered, raidеd, and now cornered"
lyric,It's hard to fight when thе fight ain't fair
lyric,"We're getting stronger now, find things they never found"
lyric,They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared
lyric,"You can walk away, say we don't need this"
lyric,But there’s something in your eyes says we can beat this
lyric,’Cause these things will change
lyric,Can you feel it now?
lyric,These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
lyric,"This revolution, the time will come"
lyric,For us to finally win
lyric,"And we'll sing hallelujah, we’ll sing hallelujah"

lyric,"Tonight, we'll stand, get off our knees"
lyric,Fight for what we've worked for all these years
lyric,"And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives"
lyric,But we’ll stand up champions tonight
lyric,It was the night things changed
lyric,Can you see it now?
lyric,When the walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
lyric,"It's a revolution, throw your hands up"
lyric,Cause we never gave in

lyric,I don't know what else I can say
lyric,I'll leave my window open
lyric,Cause I'm too tired at night for all these games
lyric,Just know I'm right here hoping
lyric,That you'll come in with the rain
lyric,I could go back to every laugh
lyric,But I don't wanna go there anymore
lyric,This is wrong but I can't help but feel like
lyric,There ain’t nothing more right babe
lyric,Misty morning comes again and I can't
lyric,Help but wish I could see your face
lyric,And I knew from the first note played
lyric,I'd be breaking all my rules to see you
lyric,You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row
lyric,Scream your name
lyric,"So dim that spotlight, tell me things like"
lyric,I can't keep my eyes off of you
lyric,"I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl"
lyric,Who's desperately in love with you
lyric,"Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar"
lyric,Morning lonelinеss
lyric,Comes around when I'm not dreaming about you
lyric,Whеn my world wakes up today
lyric,You'll be in another town
lyric,And I knew when I saw your face
lyric,I'd be counting down the ways to see you
lyric,You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row
lyric,Scream your name
lyric,"So dim that spotlight, tell me things like"
lyric,I can't take my eyes off of you
lyric,"I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl"
lyric,Who's desperately in love with you
lyric,"Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar"
lyric,"You played in bars, you play guitar"
lyric,And I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
lyric,"And you'll never see, you sing me to sleep"
lyric,Every night from the radio
lyric,"So dim that spotlight, tell me things like"
lyric,I can't take my eyes off of you
lyric,"I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl"
lyric,Who's desperately in love with you
lyric,"Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar"
lyric,"Sweet, sweet superstar"
lyric,Superstar
lyric,In the heat of the fight I walked away
lyric,Ignorin' words that you were sayin'
lyric,Tryna make me stay
lyric,"I said, ""This time I've had enough"""
lyric,And you've called a hundred times
lyric,But I'm not picking up
lyric,Cause I'm so mad I might tell you that it's over
lyric,But if you look a little closer
lyric,"I said, ""Leave,"" but all I really want is you"
lyric,To stand outside my window throwin' pebbles
lyric,"Screamin', ""I'm in love with you"""
lyric,"Wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more"
lyric,And don't you leave 'cause I know
lyric,All I need is on the other side of the door
lyric,Me and my stupid pride are sittin' here alone
lyric,"Goin' through the photographs, starin' at the phone"
lyric,I keep goin' back over things we both said
lyric,And I remember the slamming door
lyric,And all the things that I misread
lyric,"Oh, babe, if you know everything"
lyric,Tell me why you couldn't see
lyric,"When I left, I wanted you to chase after me, yeah"
lyric,"I said, ""Leave,"" but all I really want is you"
lyric,To stand outside my window throwin' pebbles
lyric,"Screamin', ""I'm in love with you"""
lyric,"Wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more"
lyric,And don't you leave 'cause I know
lyric,All I need is on the other side of the door
lyric,And I'll scream out the window
lyric,I can't even look at you
lyric,"I don't need you but I do, I do, I do"
lyric,"I say, ""There's nothing you can say"
lyric,"To make this right again, I mean it, I mean it"""
lyric,But what I mean is
lyric,"I said, ""Leave,"" but, baby, all I want is you"
lyric,To stand outside my window throwin' pebbles
lyric,"Screamin', ""I'm in love with you"""
lyric,"Wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more"
lyric,And don't you leave 'cause I know
lyric,All I need is on the other side of the door
lyric,With your face and the beautiful eyes
lyric,And the conversation with the little white lies
lyric,And the faded picture of a beautiful night
lyric,You carried me from your car up the stairs
lyric,"And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess?"
lyric,After everything and that little black dress
lyric,"After everything I must confess, I need you"
lyric,Today was a fairytale
lyric,You were the prince
lyric,I used to be a damsel in distress
lyric,You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
lyric,Today was a fairytale
lyric,Today was a fairytale
lyric,Today was a fairytale
lyric,I wore a dress
lyric,You wore a dark gray t-shirt
lyric,You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess
lyric,Today was a fairytale
lyric,Time slows down
lyric,Whenever you're around
lyric,Can you feel this magic in the air?
lyric,It must have been the way you kissed me
lyric,Fell in love when I saw you standing there
lyric,It must have been the way
lyric,Today was a fairytale
lyric,It must have been the way
lyric,Today was a fairytale
lyric,Today was a fairytale
lyric,You've got a smile
lyric,That takes me to another planet
lyric,"Every move you make, everything you say is right"
lyric,Today was a fairytale
lyric,Today was a fairytale
lyric,All that I can say
lyric,Is now it's getting so much clearer
lyric,Nothing made sense 'til the time I saw your face
lyric,Today was a fairytale
lyric,Time slows down
lyric,"Whenever you're around, yeah"
lyric,But can you feel this magic in the air?
lyric,It must have been the way you kissed me
lyric,Fell in love when I saw you standing there
lyric,It must have been the way
lyric,Today was a fairytale
lyric,It must have been the way
lyric,Today was a fairytale
lyric,Time slows down
lyric,Whenever you're around
lyric,I can feel my heart
lyric,It's beating in my chest
lyric,Did you feel it?
lyric,I can't put this down
lyric,But can you feel this magic in the air?
lyric,It must have been the way you kissed me
lyric,Fell in love when I saw you standing there
lyric,It must have been the way
lyric,But can you feel this magic in the air?
lyric,It must have been the way you kissed me
lyric,Fell in love when I saw you standing there
lyric,It must have been the way
lyric,Today was a fairytale
lyric,It must have been the way
lyric,Today was a fairytale
lyric,"Oh, oh, yeah, oh-oh"
lyric,Today was a fairytale
lyric,Once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement
lyric,"Shouldn't I find a stain, but I never do"
lyric,The way the tires turn stones on old county roads
lyric,"They leave 'em muddy underneath, reminds me of you"
lyric,You find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls
lyric,"You know, you can scratch it right off, it's how it used to be"
lyric,"But like the dollar in your pocket, it's been spent and traded in"
lyric,"You can't change where it's been, reminds me of me"
lyric,"I lived, and I learned, had you, got burned"
lyric,"Held out, and held on"
lyric,"God knows, too long, and wasted time"
lyric,"Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here"
lyric,But no amount of freedom gets you clean
lyric,I've still got you all over me
lyric,The best and worst day of June
lyric,Was the one that I met you
lyric,With your hands in your pockets
lyric,"And your ""Don't you wish you had me?"" grin"
lyric,"Well I did, so I smiled"
lyric,And I melted like a child
lyric,Now every breath of air I breathe reminds me of then
lyric,"And I lived, and I learned, had you, got burned"
lyric,"Held out, and held on"
lyric,"God knows, too long, and wasted time"
lyric,"Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here"
lyric,But no amount of freedom gets you clean
lyric,I've still got you all over me
lyric,"I lived, and I learned"
lyric,And found out what it was to turn around
lyric,And see that we
lyric,Were never really meant to be
lyric,"So I lied, and I cried"
lyric,And I watched a part of myself die
lyric,Cause no amount of freedom gets you clean
lyric,I've still got you all over me
lyric,I've still got you all over me
lyric,Still got you all over me
lyric,"Mr. ""Perfect face"""
lyric,"Mr. ""Here to stay"""
lyric,"Mr. ""Looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away"""
lyric,Everything was right
lyric,"Mr. ""I've been waitin' for you all my life"""
lyric,"Mr. ""Every single day until the end, I will be by your side"""
lyric,"But that was when I got to know Mr. ""Change of heart"""
lyric,"Mr. ""Leaves me all alone,"" I fall apart"
lyric,It takes everything in me just to get up each day

lyric,Cause I hear he's got his arm 'round a brand-new girl
lyric,"I've been pickin' up my heart, he's been pickin' up her"
lyric,And I never got past what you put me through
lyric,But it's wonderful to see that it never phased you

lyric,You said you'd never go away
lyric,We used to walk along the streets
lyric,When the porch lights were shining bright
lyric,Before I had somewhere to be
lyric,Back when we had all night and we were happy
lyric,"I do recall a good while back, we snuck into the circus"
lyric,"You threw your arms around my neck, back when I deserved it"
lyric,And we were happy
lyric,"When it was good, baby, it was good, baby"
lyric,We showed 'em all up
lyric,No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
lyric,Talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday
lyric,And we were happy
lyric,We used to watch the sun go down on the boats in the water
lyric,That's sorta how I feel right now
lyric,And goodbye's so much harder 'cause we were happy
lyric,"When it was good, baby, it was good, baby"
lyric,We showed 'em all up
lyric,No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
lyric,Talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday
lyric,And we were happy
lyric,We were happy
lyric,"Oh, I hate those voices telling me I'm not in love anymore"
lyric,But they don't give me choices and that's what these tears are for
lyric,Cause we were happy
lyric,We were happy
lyric,"When it was good, baby, it was good, baby"
lyric,We showed 'em all up
lyric,No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
lyric,Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
lyric,And you were gonna marry me
lyric,And we were happy
lyric,We were happy
lyric,Oh-oh-oh-oh
lyric,We were happy
lyric,"You said, ""I know"""
lyric,"When I said, ""I need some time, need some space"
lyric,"To think about all of this"""
lyric,You watched me go
lyric,And I knew my
lyric,Words were hard to hear
lyric,And harder to ever take back
lyric,"And I said, ""When can I-I-I come back?"""
lyric,And you said that's when
lyric,When I wake up in the morning
lyric,"That's when, when it's sunny or storming"
lyric,"Laughing, when I'm crying"
lyric,"And that's when, I'll be waiting at the front gate"
lyric,"That's when, when I see your face"
lyric,"I'll let you in, and baby, that's when"
lyric,"Mm, mm"
lyric,"I said, ""I know"""
lyric,"When you said, ""I did you wrong"
lyric,Made mistakes
lyric,"And put you through all of this"" (through all of this)"
lyric,Then through the phone
lyric,Came all your tears
lyric,"And I said, ""Leave those all in our past"""
lyric,"And you said, ""When can I-I-I come back?"""
lyric,"And I said, that's when"
lyric,When I wake up in the morning
lyric,"That's when, when it's sunny or storming"

lyric,"That's when, when I see your face"
lyric,"I'll let you in, and baby, that's when"""
lyric,"And you said, ""Honestly"
lyric,When you were gone
lyric,"Did you ever think of me?"""
lyric,And I said
lyric,"That's when, when I woke up in the morning
That's when, it was sunny or storming
Laughing when I was crying
And that's when, you were waiting at the front gate
That's when, when I saw your face
You let me in, and baby, that's when"
lyric,"That's when, when I wake up in the morning (Yeah)"
lyric,"That's when, when it's sunny or storming"
lyric,"When I'm laughing, when I'm crying"
lyric,That's when I'll be waiting at the front gate

lyric,"That's when, when I see your face"
lyric,"That's when I love you, that's when"
lyric,"Hey, I knew I'd run into you somewhere"
lyric,"It's been a while, I didn't mean to stare"
lyric,I heard she's nothin' like me
lyric,I'm sure she'll make you happy
lyric,"But don't you, don't you"
lyric,Smile at me and ask me how I've been
lyric,Don't you say you've
lyric,Missed me if you don't want me again
lyric,You don't know how much I feel I love you still
lyric,"So why don't you, don't you?"
lyric,"Ah, ah, ah, ah"
lyric,"Ah, ah, ah"
lyric,"Sometimes, I really wish that I could hate you"
lyric,"I've tried, but that's just somethin' I can't do"
lyric,My heart knows what the truth is
lyric,I swore I wouldn't do this
lyric,"But don't you, don't you"
lyric,Smile at me and ask me how I've been
lyric,Don't you say you've
lyric,Missed me if you don't want me again
lyric,You don't know how much I feel I love you still
lyric,"So why don't you, don't you?"
lyric,So I walk outta here tonight
lyric,Try to go on with my life
lyric,And you can say we're still friends
lyric,(But I don't wanna pretend)
lyric,So if I see you again
lyric,"Don't you (Don't you), don't you"
lyric,Smile at me and ask me how I've been
lyric,Don't you (Don't you) say you've
lyric,Missed me if you don't want me again
lyric,You don't (You don't) know how much I feel I love you still
lyric,"So why don't you, don't you?"
lyric,"Ah, ah, ah, ah"
lyric,"Don't you (Ah, ah, ah)"
lyric,It wasn't just like a movie
lyric,"The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin"
lyric,"I'm drivin' away and I, I guess you could say"
lyric,This is the last time I'll drive this way again
lyric,Lost in the gray and I try to grab at the fray
lyric,"Cause I, I still love you but I can't"
lyric,Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
lyric,Bye bye baby
lyric,I want you bad but it's come down to nothing
lyric,And all I have is your sympathy
lyric,Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
lyric,Bye bye baby
lyric,Bye bye baby
lyric,The picture frame is empty
lyric,"On the dresser, vacant just like me"
lyric,I see your writing on the dash
lyric,Then back to your hesitation
lyric,I was so sure of everything
lyric,Everything I thought we'd always have
lyric,Guess I never doubted it
lyric,Then the here and the now floods in
lyric,Feels like I'm becoming a part of your past
lyric,Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
lyric,Bye bye baby
lyric,I want you bad but it's come down to nothing
lyric,And all I have is your sympathy
lyric,Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
lyric,Bye bye baby
lyric,And there's so much that I can't touch
lyric,You're all I want but it's not enough this time
lyric,And all the pages are just slipping through my hands
lyric,And I'm so scared of how this ends
lyric,Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
lyric,Bye bye baby
lyric,I want you bad but it's come down to nothing
lyric,And all I have is your sympathy
lyric,Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
lyric,Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
lyric,Bye bye baby
lyric,I want you bad but it's come down to nothing
lyric,And all I have is your sympathy
lyric,Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
lyric,"Oh, you took me home, I thought you were gonna keep me"
lyric,Bye bye baby
lyric,Bye bye baby
lyric,"You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables"
lyric,Left a small town and never looked back
lyric,"I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling"
lyric,"Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts"
lyric,"I say, ""Can you believe it?"""
lyric,As we're lying on the couch
lyric,"The moment, I could see it"
lyric,"Yes, yes, I can see it now"
lyric,"Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?"
lyric,You put your arm around me for the first time
lyric,You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
lyric,You are the best thing that's ever been mine
lyric,"Flash forward, and we're taking on the world together"
lyric,And there's a drawer of my things at your place
lyric,You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
lyric,You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes
lyric,But we got bills to pay
lyric,We got nothing figured out
lyric,When it was hard to take
lyric,"Yes, yes"
lyric,This is what I thought about:
lyric,"Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?"
lyric,You put your arm around me for the first time
lyric,You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
lyric,You are the best thing that's ever been mine
lyric,Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
lyric,You saw me start to believe for the first time
lyric,You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
lyric,You are the best thing that's ever been mine
lyric,"And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM"
lyric,As everything was slipping right out of our hands
lyric,"I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street"
lyric,Braced myself for the goodbye
lyric,Cause that's all I've ever known
lyric,"Then, you took me by surprise"
lyric,"You said, ""I'll never leave you alone."""
lyric,"You said, ""I remember how we felt, sitting by the water"
lyric,"And every time I look at you, it's like the first time"
lyric,I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
lyric,"She is the best thing that's ever been mine"""
lyric,"Hold on, make it last"
lyric,"Hold on, never turn back"
lyric,You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
lyric,You are the best thing that's ever been mine
lyric,"Yeah, yeah"
lyric,Do you believe it? (Hold on)
lyric,We're gonna make it now (Hold on)
lyric,And I can see it
lyric,"Yeah, yeah"
lyric,I can see it now (See it now)
lyric,The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
lyric,And I'm a house of cards
lyric,You're the kind of reckless
lyric,That should send me running
lyric,But I kinda know that I won't get far
lyric,And you stood there in front of me
lyric,Just close enough to touch
lyric,Close enough to hope you couldn't see
lyric,What I was thinking of
lyric,Drop everything now
lyric,Meet me in the pouring rain
lyric,Kiss me on the sidewalk
lyric,Take away the pain
lyric,Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
lyric,"Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down"
lyric,Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
lyric,Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
lyric,My mind forgets to remind me
lyric,You're a bad idea
lyric,You touch me once and it's really something
lyric,You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be
lyric,I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
lyric,But with you I know it's no good
lyric,And I could wait patiently but I really wish you would
lyric,Drop everything now
lyric,Meet me in the pouring rain
lyric,Kiss me on the sidewalk
lyric,Take away the pain
lyric,Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
lyric,"Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down"
lyric,Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
lyric,Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
lyric,I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
lyric,Just keep on keeping your eyes on me
lyric,It's just wrong enough to make it feel right
lyric,And lead me up the staircase
lyric,Won't you whisper soft and slow?
lyric,"I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show"
lyric,Drop everything now
lyric,Meet me in the pouring rain
lyric,Kiss me on the sidewalk
lyric,Take away the pain
lyric,Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
lyric,"Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down"
lyric,Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
lyric,Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
lyric,And the sparks fly
lyric,"Oh, baby, smile"
lyric,And the sparks fly
lyric,I'm so glad you made time to see me
lyric,"How's life? Tell me, how's your family?"
lyric,I haven't seen them in a while
lyric,"You've been good, busier than ever"
lyric,"We small talk, work and the weather"
lyric,Your guard is up and I know why
lyric,Because the last time you saw me
lyric,Is still burned in the back of your mind
lyric,"You gave me roses, and I left them there to die"
lyric,So this is me swallowing my pride
lyric,"Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night"
lyric,And I go back to December all the time
lyric,It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
lyric,Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
lyric,"I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright"
lyric,I go back to December all the time
lyric,"These days, I haven't been sleeping"
lyric,"Staying up, playing back myself leaving"
lyric,When your birthday passed and I didn't call
lyric,"And I think about summer, all the beautiful times"
lyric,I watched you laughing from the passenger side and
lyric,Realized I loved you in the fall
lyric,And then the cold came
lyric,The dark days when fear crept into my mind
lyric,"You gave me all your love, and all I gave you was goodbye"
lyric,So this is me swallowing my pride
lyric,"Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night"
lyric,And I go back to December all the time
lyric,It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
lyric,Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
lyric,"I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind"
lyric,I go back to December all the time
lyric,"I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile"
lyric,"So good to me, so right"
lyric,And how you held me in your arms that September night
lyric,The first time you ever saw me cry
lyric,Maybe this is wishful thinking
lyric,Probably mindless dreaming
lyric,"But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right"
lyric,"I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't"
lyric,"So if the chain is on your door, I understand"
lyric,But this is me swallowing my pride
lyric,"Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night"
lyric,And I go back to December
lyric,It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
lyric,Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
lyric,"I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright"
lyric,"I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind"
lyric,I go back to December all the time
lyric,All the time
lyric,I am not the kind of girl
lyric,Who should be rudely barging in
lyric,On a white veil occasion
lyric,But you are not the kind of boy
lyric,Who should be marrying the wrong girl
lyric,I sneak in and see your friends
lyric,And her snotty little family
lyric,All dressed in pastel
lyric,And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
lyric,Somewhere back inside a room
lyric,Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry
lyric,This is surely not
lyric,What you thought it would be
lyric,I lose myself in a daydream
lyric,Where I stand and say
lyric,"Don't say yes, run away now"
lyric,I'll meet you when you're out
lyric,Of the church at the back door
lyric,Don't wait or say a single vow
lyric,You need to hear me out
lyric,"And they said, ""speak now"""
lyric,Fond gestures are exchanged
lyric,And the organ starts to play
lyric,A song that sounds like a death march
lyric,And I am hiding in the curtains
lyric,It seems that I was uninvited
lyric,By your lovely bride-to-be
lyric,She floats down the aisle
lyric,Like a pageant queen
lyric,But I know you wish it was me
lyric,You wish it was me (Don't you)
lyric,"Don't say yes, run away now"

lyric,"There's the silence, there's my last chance"
lyric,"I stand up with shaking hands, all eyes on me"
lyric,Horrified looks from everyone in the room
lyric,But I'm only looking at you
lyric,I am not the kind of girl
lyric,Who should be rudely barging in
lyric,On a white veil occasion
lyric,But you are not the kind of boy
lyric,Who should be marrying the wrong girl
lyric,(Hehe!)
lyric,"So don't say yes, run away now"

I'll meet you when
I'm out of my tux at the back door
Baby, I didn't say my vows
So glad you were around when they said
Speak now'"
lyric,Long were the nights when
lyric,My days once revolved around you
lyric,Counting my footsteps
lyric,Praying the floor won't fall through... again
lyric,My mother accused me of losing my mind
lyric,But I swore I was fine
lyric,You paint me a blue sky
lyric,Then go back and turn it to rain
lyric,And I lived in your chess game
lyric,But you changed the rules everyday
lyric,"Wonderin' which version of you I might get on the phone, tonight"
lyric,"Well, I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why"
lyric,"Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone"
lyric,Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
lyric,The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
lyric,I shoulda known
lyric,"Well, maybe it's me"
lyric,And my blind optimism to blame
lyric,Or maybe it's you and your sick need
lyric,To give love and take it away
lyric,And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
lyric,Who don't understand
lyric,And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said
lyric,Run as fast as you can
lyric,"Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone"
lyric,Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
lyric,The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
lyric,"Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong"
lyric,Don't you think nineteen's too young
lyric,"To be played by your dark, twisted games"
lyric,When I loved you so?
lyric,I shoulda known
lyric,You are an expert at sorry
lyric,And keeping lines blurry
lyric,Never impressed by me acing your tests
lyric,All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes
lyric,Cause you burned them out
lyric,But I took your matches
lyric,Before fire could catch me
lyric,So don't look now
lyric,I'm shining like fireworks
lyric,"Over your sad empty town, yeah"
lyric,"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"

lyric,You shoulda known
lyric,You shoulda known
lyric,Don't you think I was too young?
lyric,You shoulda known
lyric,"You, with your words like knives"
lyric,And swords and weapons that you use against me
lyric,You have knocked me off my feet again
lyric,Got me feeling like I'm nothing
lyric,"You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard"
lyric,Calling me out when I'm wounded
lyric,"You, picking on the weaker man"
lyric,"Well, you can take me down"
lyric,With just one single blow
lyric,But you don't know what you don't know
lyric,"Someday, I'll be living in a big old city"

lyric,Why you gotta be so mean?
lyric,"You, with your switching sides"
lyric,And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
lyric,You have pointed out my flaws again

lyric,She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
lyric,She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
lyric,I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling
lyric,And she thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things
lyric,But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
lyric,Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go

lyric,For just us to know
lyric,You told me you loved me
lyric,So why did you go away?
lyric,Away
lyric,I do recall now the smell of the rain
lyric,Fresh on the pavement
lyric,I ran off the plane
lyric,That July 9th
lyric,The beat of your heart
lyric,It jumps through your shirt
lyric,I can still feel your arms
lyric,But now I'll go sit on the floor
lyric,Wearing your clothes
lyric,All that I know is
lyric,I don't know how to be something you miss
lyric,I never thought we'd have a last kiss
lyric,Never imagined we'd end like this

lyric,"The life of the party, you're showing off again"
lyric,And I roll my eyes and then
lyric,You pull me in
lyric,I'm not much for dancing
lyric,But for you I did
lyric,"Because I love your handshake, meeting my father"
lyric,I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
lyric,How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something
lyric,There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions

lyric,And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
lyric,Hope it's nice where you are
lyric,And I hope the sun shines
lyric,And it's a beautiful day
lyric,And something reminds you
lyric,You wish you had stayed
lyric,You can plan for a change in weather and time

lyric,Of all the years that we stood there
lyric,On the side-lines wishing for right now
lyric,We are the kings and the queens
lyric,You traded your baseball cap for a crown
lyric,When they gave us our trophies
lyric,And we held them up for our town
lyric,And the cynics were outraged
lyric,"Screaming, ""This is absurd"""
lyric,"Cause for a moment, a band of thieves"
lyric,In ripped up jeans got to rule the world
lyric,Long live the walls we crashed through
lyric,All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
lyric,"I was screaming, long live all the magic we made"
lyric,And bring on all the pretenders
lyric,I'm not afraid
lyric,Long live all the mountains we moved
lyric,I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you

lyric,And bring on all the pretenders
lyric,"One day, we will be remembered"
lyric,Hold on to spinning around
lyric,Confetti falls to the ground
lyric,May these memories break our fall
lyric,Will you take a moment?
lyric,Promise me this
lyric,That you'll stand by me forever
lyric,"But if, God forbid, fate should step in"
lyric,And force us into a goodbye
lyric,If you have children some day
lyric,When they point to the pictures
lyric,Please tell them my name
lyric,Tell them how the crowds went wild
lyric,Tell them how I hope they shine
lyric,Long live the walls we crashed through
lyric,"I had the time of my life, with you"
lyric,"Long, long live the walls we crashed through"
lyric,All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
lyric,"I was screaming, long live all the magic we made"
lyric,And bring on all the pretenders
lyric,I'm not afraid
lyric,"Singing, long live all the mountains we moved"
lyric,I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
lyric,"And long, long live that look on your face"
lyric,And bring on all the pretenders
lyric,"One day, we will be remembered"
lyric,Elevator buttons and morning air
lyric,Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs
lyric,"If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares"
lyric,"But right now, my time is theirs"
lyric,Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
lyric,They'll judge it like they know about me and you
lyric,And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
lyric,"The jury's out, but my choice is you"
lyric,So don't you worry your pretty little mind
lyric,People throw rocks at things that shine
lyric,And life makes love look hard
lyric,"The stakes are high, the water's rough"
lyric,But this love is ours
lyric,You never know what people have up their sleeves
lyric,Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
lyric,Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
lyric,"But I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine"
lyric,And you'll say
lyric,Don't you worry your pretty little mind
lyric,People throw rocks at things that shine
lyric,And life makes love look hard
lyric,"The stakes are high, the water's rough"
lyric,But this love is ours
lyric,And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong
lyric,"And your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong"
lyric,And I'll fight their doubt and give you faith
lyric,With this song for you
lyric,Cause I love the gap between your teeth
lyric,And I love the riddles that you speak
lyric,And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos
lyric,Will be ignored
lyric,Cause my heart is yours
lyric,So don't you worry your pretty little mind
lyric,People throw rocks at things that shine
lyric,And life makes love look hard
lyric,Don't you worry your pretty little mind
lyric,People throw rocks at things that shine
lyric,But they can't take what's ours
lyric,They can't take what's ours
lyric,"The stakes are high, the water's rough"
lyric,But this love is ours
lyric,"Last night, I heard my own heart beating"
lyric,Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
lyric,Six months gone and I'm still reaching
lyric,Even though I know you're not there
lyric,"I was playing back a thousand memories, baby"
lyric,Thinkin' 'bout everything we've been through
lyric,Maybe I've been going back too much lately
lyric,When time stood still and I had you
lyric,"Come back, come back, come back to me like"
lyric,"You would, you would if this was a movie"
lyric,Stand in the rain outside till I came out
lyric,"Come back, come back, come back to me like"
lyric,"You could, you could if you just said you're sorry"
lyric,I know that we could work it out somehow
lyric,But if this was a movie you'd be here by now
lyric,I know people change and these things happen
lyric,But I remember how it was back then
lyric,Wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughing
lyric,Cause nothing like this ever happened to them
lyric,"Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street"
lyric,Flashback to the night when you said to me
lyric,"Nothing's gonna change, not for me and you"
lyric,Not before I knew how much I had to lose
lyric,"Come back, come back, come back to me like"
lyric,"You would, you would if this was a movie"
lyric,Stand in the rain outside till I came out
lyric,"Come back, come back, come back to me like"
lyric,"You could, you could if you just said you're sorry"
lyric,I know that we could work it out somehow
lyric,But if this was a movie you'd be here by now
lyric,"If you're out there, if you're somewhere, if you're moving on"
lyric,I've been waiting for you every day since you've been gone
lyric,I just want it back the way it was before
lyric,And I just want to see you back at my front door
lyric,"And I say, ""Come back, come back, come back to me like"
lyric,You would before you said it's not that easy
lyric,"Before the fight, before I locked you out"""
lyric,But I take it all back now
lyric,"Come back, come back, come back to me like"
lyric,"You would, you would if this was a movie"
lyric,Stand in the rain outside till I came out
lyric,"Come back, come back, come back to me like"
lyric,"You could, you could if you just said you're sorry"
lyric,I know that we could work it out somehow
lyric,But if this was a movie you'd be here by now
lyric,You'd be here by now
lyric,It's not the kind of ending you want to see now
lyric,"Baby, what about the ending?"
lyric,"Oh, I thought you'd be here by now"
lyric,Thought you'd be here by now
lyric,"Tall, dark, and superman"
lyric,He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
lyric,To save the world or go to work
lyric,It's the same thing to me
lyric,"He's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition"
lyric,I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
lyric,"I hang on every word you say, yay"
lyric,"And you smile and say, ""How are you?”"
lyric,"I say, ""Just fine"""
lyric,"I always forget to tell you, I love you"
lyric,I love you forever
lyric,I watch superman fly away
lyric,You've got a busy day today
lyric,"Go save the world, I'll be around"
lyric,I watch superman fly away
lyric,"Come back, I'll be with you someday"
lyric,I'll be right here on the ground
lyric,When you come back down
lyric,"Tall, dark and beautiful"
lyric,"He's complicated, he's irrational"
lyric,"But I hope someday you'll take me away and save the day, yeah"
lyric,Something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin'
lyric,He's not all bad like his reputation
lyric,And I can't hear one single word they say
lyric,"And you'll leave, got places to be and I'll be okay"
lyric,I always forget to tell you I love you
lyric,I loved you from the very first day
lyric,I watch superman fly away
lyric,You've got a busy day today
lyric,"Go save the world, I'll be around"
lyric,I watch superman fly away
lyric,"Come back, I'll be with you someday"
lyric,I'll be right here on the ground
lyric,When you come back down
lyric,And I watch you fly around the world
lyric,And I hope you don't save some other girl
lyric,"Don't forget, don't forget about me"
lyric,"I'm far away, but I never let you go"
lyric,I'm love-struck and looking out the window
lyric,"Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be"
lyric,"Right here, wishing the flowers were from you"
lyric,Wishing the card was from you
lyric,Wishing the call was from you
lyric,Cause I loved you from the very first day
lyric,I watch superman fly away
lyric,You've got a busy day today
lyric,"Go save the world, I'll be around"
lyric,Forever and ever here
lyric,I watch superman fly away
lyric,"I swear, I'll be with you someday"
lyric,I'll be right here on the ground
lyric,When you come back down
lyric,"La, la, la, la, la, la"
lyric,"La, la, la, la, la, la"
lyric,When you come back down

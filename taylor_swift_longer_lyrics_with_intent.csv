lyric,"He said the way my blue eyes shined Put those Georgia stars to shame that night I said, ""That's a lie"""
lyric,Just a boy in a Chevy truck That had a tendency of gettin' stuck On back roads at night
lyric,And I was right there beside him all summer long And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone But when you think Tim McGraw
lyric,I hope you think my favorite song The one we danced to all night long The moon like a spotlight on the lake
lyric,When you think happiness I hope you think that little black dress Think of my head on your chest
lyric,And my old faded blue jeans When you think Tim McGraw I hope you think of me
lyric,September saw a month of tears And thankin' God that you weren't here To see me like that
lyric,But in a box beneath my bed Is a letter that you never read From three summers back
lyric,"It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe When you think Tim McGraw"
lyric,I hope you think my favorite song The one we danced to all night long The moon like a spotlight on the lake
lyric,When you think happiness I hope you think that little black dress Think of my head on your chest
lyric,And my old faded blue jeans When you think Tim McGraw I hope you think of me
lyric,And I'm back for the first time since then I'm standin' on your street And there's a letter left on your doorstep
lyric,"And the first thing that you'll read is: When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place When you think happiness"
lyric,I hope you think that little black dress Think of my head on your chest And my old faded blue jeans
lyric,"When you think Tim McGraw I hope you think of me Oh, think of me"
lyric,Mmmm He said the way my blue eyes shined Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
lyric,"I said, ""That's a lie"" State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me"

lyric,Drew looks at me I fake a smile so he won't see That I want and I'm needing
lyric,"Everything that we should be I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about And she's got everything that I have to live without"
lyric,Drew talks to me I laugh 'cause it's just so funny That I can't even see
lyric,"Anyone when he's with me He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night"
lyric,He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do
lyric,"Drew walks by me Can he tell that I can't breathe? And there he goes, so perfectly"
lyric,"The kind of flawless I wish I could be She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause"
lyric,He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do
lyric,"So, I drive home alone As I turn out the light I'll put his picture down"
lyric,And maybe get some sleep tonight Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
lyric,"He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do He's the time taken up, but there's never enough And he's all that I need to fall into"
lyric,"Drew looks at me I fake a smile so he won't see I don't know what I want, so don't ask me"
lyric,"Cause I'm still trying to figure it out Don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking Trying to see through the rain coming down"
lyric,"Even though I'm not the only one Who feels the way I do I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know"
lyric,"I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world Got the radio on, my old blue jeans"
lyric,"And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine Could you tell me what more do I need"
lyric,"And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah But that's OK I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know"
lyric,"I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world Maybe I'm just a girl on a mission"
lyric,"But I'm ready to fly I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on"
lyric,"Oh I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know Oh I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world Oh I'm just a girl"
lyric,"Oh I'm just a girl, oh, oh Oh I'm just a girl You have a way of coming easily to me"
lyric,"And when you take, you take the very best of me So I start a fight 'cause I need to feel something And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted"
lyric,"Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day Just walk away, ain't no use defending words that you will never say And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through"
lyric,I've never been anywhere cold as you You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
lyric,"And you come away with a great little story Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day"
lyric,"So just walk away, ain't no use defending words that you will never say And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through I've never been anywhere cold as you"
lyric,"You never did give a damn thing, honey, but I cried, cried for you And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you, died for you Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day"
lyric,Every smile you fake is so condescending counting all the scars you made And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through I've never been anywhere cold as you
lyric,I didn't know what I would find When I went looking for a reason I know I didn't read between the lines
lyric,"And, baby, I've got nowhere to go I tried to take the road less traveled by But nothing seems to work the first few times"
lyric,Am I right? So how can I ever try to be better? Nobody ever lets me in
lyric,I can still see you This ain't the best view On the outside looking in
lyric,"And I've been a lot of lonely places I've never been on the outside You saw me there, but never knew"
lyric,"That I would give it all up to be A part of this, a part of you And now it's all too late. So you see"
lyric,You could've helped if you had wanted to But no one notices until it's too late to do anything So how can I ever try to be better?
lyric,Nobody ever lets me in I can still see you This ain't the best view
lyric,On the outside looking in And I've been a lot of lonely places I've never been on the outside
lyric,"Oh, yeah So how can I ever try to be better? Nobody ever lets me in"
lyric,And I can still see you This ain't the best view On the outside looking in
lyric,And I've been a lot of lonely places I've never been on the outside Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty
lyric,Is the face in the mirror looking back at you You walk around here thinking you're not pretty But that's not true 'cause I know you
lyric,"Hold on, baby, you're losing it The water's high, you're jumping into it And letting go"
lyric,"And no one knows That you cry, but you don't tell anyone That you might not be the golden one"
lyric,And you're tied together with a smile But you're coming undone I guess it's true that love was all you wanted
lyric,Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change Hoping it will end up in his pocket But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
lyric,"Oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay It's not his price to pay Hold on, baby, you're losing it"
lyric,"The water's high, you're jumping into it And letting go And no one knows"
lyric,"That you cry, but you don't tell anyone That you might not be the golden one And you're tied together with a smile"
lyric,"But you're coming undone Hold on, baby, you're losing it The water's high, you're jumping into it"
lyric,"And letting go And no one knows That you cry, but you don't tell anyone"
lyric,That you might not be the golden one And you're tied together with a smile But you're coming undone
lyric,"You're tied together with a smile But you're coming undone Goodbye, baby"
lyric,"With a smile, baby, baby Cory's eyes are like a jungle He smiles, it's like the radio"
lyric,He whispers songs into my window In words that nobody knows There's pretty girls on every corner
lyric,"That watch him as he's walking home Saying, ""Does he know?"" Will you ever know?"
lyric,You're beautiful Every little piece love And don't you know
lyric,You're really gonna be someone Ask anyone And when you find everything you looked for
lyric,"I hope your life leads you back to my door Oh, but if it don't Stay beautiful"
lyric,Cory finds another way to be The highlight of my day I'm taking pictures in my mind
lyric,So I can save them for a rainy day It's hard to make a conversation When he's taking my breath away
lyric,"I should say, hey, by the way You're beautiful Every little piece love"
lyric,And don't you know You're really gonna be someone Ask anyone
lyric,"And when you find everything you looked for I hope your life leads you back to my door Oh, but if it don't"
lyric,Stay beautiful If you and I are a story That never gets told
lyric,If what you are is a daydream I'll never get to hold At least you'll know
lyric,You're beautiful Every little piece love And don't you know
lyric,You're really gonna be someone Ask anyone And when you find everything you looked for
lyric,"I hope your life leads you back to my front door Oh, but if it don't Will you stay"
lyric,"Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful? La la la"
lyric,"Oh, oh, oh, oh Oh, but if it don't Stay beautiful"
lyric,"Stay beautiful Na, na, na, na, na It's strange to think the songs we used to sing"
lyric,"The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone Yesterday I found out about you Even now just looking at you feels wrong"
lyric,"You say that you'd take it all back, given one chance It was a moment of weakness and you said, ""Yes."" You should've said ""No"", you should've gone home"
lyric,You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go You should've known that word Bout what you did with her'd
lyric,"Get back to me (get back to me). And I should've been there in the back of your mind I shouldn't be asking myself, ""Why?"""
lyric,"You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet... You should've said ""No"", baby, and you might still have me You can see that I've been crying"
lyric,"And baby, you know all the right things to say But do you honestly expect me to believe We could ever be the same?"
lyric,"You say that the past is the past, you need one chance It was a moment of weakness and you said, ""Yes."" You should've said ""No"", you should've gone home"
lyric,"You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go You should've known that word Bout what you did with her'd,"
lyric,"Get back to me (get back to me). And I should've been there in the back of your mind I shouldn't be asking myself, ""Why?"""
lyric,"You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet... You should've said ""No"", baby, and you might still have me I can't resist"
lyric,"Before you go, tell me this: Was it worth it? Was she worth this?"
lyric,"No... no, no, no... You should've said ""No"", you should've gone home You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go"
lyric,"You should've known that word Bout what you did with her'd, Get back to me (get back to me)."
lyric,"And I should've been there in the back of your mind I shouldn't be asking myself, ""Why?"" You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet..."
lyric,"You should've said ""No"", baby, and you might still have me She said, I was seven and you were nine I looked at you like the stars that shined"
lyric,"In the sky, the pretty lights And our daddies used to joke about the two of us Growing up and falling in love and our mamas smiled"
lyric,"And rolled their eyes and said, ""Oh my, my, my"" Take me back to the house in the backyard tree Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me"
lyric,"You never did, you never did Take me back when our world was one block wide I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried"
lyric,"Just two kids, you and I Oh my, my, my, my Well, I was sixteen when suddenly"
lyric,I wasn't that little girl you used to see But your eyes still shined like pretty lights And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
lyric,"They never believed we'd really fall in love And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes And said, ""Oh my, my, my"""
lyric,"Take me back to the creek beds we turned up Two A.M. riding in your truck, and all I need is you next to me Take me back to the time we had our very first fight"
lyric,"The slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight You stayed outside 'til the morning light Oh my, my, my, my"
lyric,"A few years had gone and come around We were sitting at our favorite spot in town And you looked at me, got down on one knee"
lyric,"Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle Our whole town came and our mamas cried You said ""I do"" and I did too"
lyric,"Take me home where we met so many years before We'll rock our babies on that very front porch After all this time, you and I"
lyric,"I'll be eighty-seven; you'll be eighty-nine I'll still look at you like the stars that shine In the sky, oh my, my, my"
lyric,I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone In the front seat of his car He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
lyric,"The other on my heart I look around, turn the radio down He says, ""Baby, is something wrong?"""
lyric,"I say, ""Nothin', I was just thinkin' How we don't have a song"" And he says"
lyric,"Our song is the slamming screen door Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window When we're on the phone and you talk real slow"
lyric,"Cause it's late and your mama don't know Our song is the way you laugh The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"""
lyric,And when I got home 'fore I said amen Asking God if he could play it again I was walking up the front porch steps
lyric,After everything that day Had gone all wrong or been trampled on And lost and thrown away
lyric,"Got to the hallway, well on my way To my lovin' bed I almost didn't notice all the roses"
lyric,"And the note that said Our song is the slamming screen door Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window"
lyric,When we're on the phone and you talk real slow Cause it's late and your mama don't know Our song is the way you laugh
lyric,"The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"" And when I got home 'fore I said amen Asking God if he could play it again"
lyric,"Da-da-da-da I've heard every album, listened to the radio Waited for somethin' to come along"
lyric,"That was as good as our song Cause our song is the slamming screen door Sneakin' out late, tappin' on his window"
lyric,When we're on the phone and he talks real slow Cause it's late and his mama don't know Our song is the way he laughs
lyric,"The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have"" And when I got home 'fore I said amen Asking God if he could play it again"
lyric,"Play it again, oh, yeah Oh, oh, yeah I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone"
lyric,In the front seat of his car I grabbed a pen and an old napkin And I wrote down our song
lyric,Friday night beneath the stars In a field behind your yard You and I are painting pictures in the sky
lyric,And sometimes we don't say a thing Just listen to the crickets sing Everything I need is right here by my side
lyric,And I know everything about you I don't wanna live without you I'm only up when you're not down
lyric,"Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground It's like no matter what I do Well, you drive me crazy half the time"
lyric,"The other half, I'm only tryna Let you know that what I feel is true And I'm only me when I'm with you"
lyric,Just a small-town boy and girl Living in a crazy world Tryna figure out what is and isn't true
lyric,And I don't try to hide my tears My secrets or my deepest fears Through it all nobody gets me like you do
lyric,And you know everything about me You say that you can't live without me I'm only up when you're not down
lyric,"Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground It's like no matter what I do Well, you drive me crazy half the time"
lyric,"The other half, I'm only tryna Let you know that what I feel is true And I'm only me when I'm with you"
lyric,When I'm with anybody else It's so hard to be myself And only you can tell
lyric,That I'm only up when you're not down Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground It's like no matter what I do
lyric,"Well, you drive me crazy half the time The other half, I'm only tryna Let you know that what I feel is true"
lyric,"And I'm only me, who I wanna be Well, I'm only me when I'm with you With you"
lyric,"Uh-huh, yeah She can't see the way your eyes Light up when you smile"
lyric,She'll never notice how you stop and stare Whenever she walks by And you can't see me wanting you the way you want her
lyric,But you are everything to me And I just wanna show you She don't even know you
lyric,She's never gonna love you like I want to And you just see right through me But if you only knew me
lyric,We could be a beautiful Miracle Unbelievable
lyric,"Instead of just invisible Oh, yeah There's a fire inside of you"
lyric,That can't help but shine through She's never gonna see the light No matter what you do
lyric,And all I think about is how to make you think of me And everything that we could be I just wanna show you
lyric,She don't even know you She's never gonna love you like I want to And you just see right through me
lyric,If you only knew me We could be a beautiful Miracle
lyric,Unbelievable Instead of just invisible Like shadows in a faded light
lyric,"Oh, we're invisible I just wanna open your eyes And make you realize"
lyric,"I just wanna show you She don't even know you Baby, let me love you"
lyric,Let me want you You just see right through me But if you only knew me
lyric,We could be a beautiful Miracle Unbelievable
lyric,"Instead of just invisible Oh, yeah She can't see the way your eyes"
lyric,"Light up when you smile Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart? Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?"
lyric,Why would you wanna make the very first scar? Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart? Maybe I should've seen the signs
lyric,"Should've read the writing on the wall And realized by the distance in your eyes that I would be the one to fall No matter what you say, I still can't believe"
lyric,"That you would walk away It don't make sense to me, but Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?"
lyric,"Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now? Why would you wanna make the very first scar? Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?"
lyric,It's not unbroken anymore How do I get it back the way it was before? Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
lyric,"Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now? Why would you wanna make the very first scar? Why would you wanna break? Why would you wanna break it?"
lyric,"Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart? Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now? Why would you wanna make the very first scar?"
lyric,Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart? Drew looks at me I fake a smile so he won't see
lyric,What I want and I need And everything that we should be I'll bet she's beautiful
lyric,That girl he talks about And she's got everything That I have to live without
lyric,Drew talks to me I laugh 'cause it's just so funny But I can't even see
lyric,Anyone when he's with me He says he's so in love He's finally got it right
lyric,I wonder if he knows He's all I think about at night He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
lyric,The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star He's the song in the car I keep singing Don't know why I do
lyric,"Drew walks by me Can he tell that I can't breathe? And there he goes, so perfectly"
lyric,The kind of flawless I wish I could be She better hold him tight Give him all her love
lyric,Look in those beautiful eyes And know she's lucky 'cause He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
lyric,The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star He's the song in the car I keep singing Don't know why I do
lyric,So I drive home alone As I turn out the light I'll put his picture down
lyric,And maybe get some sleep tonight Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
lyric,"He's the song in the car I keep singing Don't know why I do He's the time taken up, but there's never enough"
lyric,And he's all that I need to fall into Drew looks at me I fake a smile so he won't see
lyric,I'm walking fast through the traffic lights Busy streets and busy lives And all we know is touch and go
lyric,We are alone with our changing minds We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds Or fades in time
lyric,And I never (Never) Saw you coming And I’ll never (Never)
lyric,Be the same You come around and the armor falls Pierce the room like a cannonball
lyric,"Now all we know is don’t let go We are alone, just you and me Up in your room and our slates are clean"
lyric,"Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes So you were never a saint And I've loved in shades of wrong"
lyric,We learn to live with the pain Mosaic broken hearts But this love is brave and wild
lyric,And I never (Never) Saw you coming And I’ll never (Never)
lyric,Be the same This is a state of grace This is the worthwhile fight
lyric,Love is a ruthless game Unless you play it good and right These are the hands of fate
lyric,You’re my Achilles heel This is the golden age Of something good and right and real
lyric,And I never (Never) Saw you coming And I’ll never
lyric,Be the same And I never (Never) Saw you coming
lyric,And I’ll never (So you were never a saint) (And I've loved in shades of wrong) Be the same (We learn to live with the pain)
lyric,(Mosaic broken hearts) (But this love is brave and wild) This is a state of grace
lyric,This is the worthwhile fight Love is a ruthless game Unless you play it good and right
lyric,"Loving him is like Driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street Faster than the wind, passionate as sin"
lyric,Ending so suddenly Loving him is like trying to change your mind Once you're already flying through the free fall
lyric,"Like the colors in autumn, so bright Just before they lose it all Losing him was blue like I'd never known"
lyric,"Missing him was dark gray, all alone Forgetting him was like Trying to know somebody you never met"
lyric,"But loving him was red (Red, red) (Red, red)"
lyric,"Loving him was red (Red, red) (Red, red)"
lyric,Touching him was like Realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you Memorizing him was as
lyric,Easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song Fighting with him was like Trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
lyric,Regretting him was like Wishing you never found out that love could be that strong Losing him was blue like I'd never known
lyric,"Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Whoa) Forgetting him was like Trying to know somebody you never met"
lyric,"But loving him was red (Red, red) Oh, red (Red, red)"
lyric,"Burning red (Red, red) (Red, red) Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes"
lyric,"Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go But moving on from him is impossible When I still see it all in my head"
lyric,"In burning red Burning, it was red Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known"
lyric,"Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Whoa) Forgetting him was like Trying to know somebody you never met"
lyric,"Cause loving him was red (Red, red) Yeah, yeah, red (Red, red) Burning red (Red, red)"
lyric,"(Red, red) And that's why (Red, red) he's spinning 'round in my head Comes back to me (Red, red), burning red"
lyric,"(Red, red) Yeah, yeah (Red, red) His love was like"
lyric,Driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street Put your lips close to mine As long as they don't touch
lyric,"Out of focus, eye to eye Til the gravity's too much And I'll do anything you say"
lyric,If you say it with your hands And I'd be smart to walk away But you're quicksand
lyric,This slope is treacherous This path is reckless This slope is treacherous
lyric,And I-I-I like it I can't decide if it's a choice Getting swept away
lyric,I hear the sound of my own voice Asking you to stay And all we are is skin and bone
lyric,Trained to get along Forever going with the flow But you're friction
lyric,[Chorus] This slope is treacherous This path is reckless
lyric,"This slope is treacherous I, I, I like it Two headlights shine through the sleepless night"
lyric,"And I will get you, get you alone Your name has echoed through my mind And I just think you should, think you should know"
lyric,"That nothing safe is worth the drive And I would follow you, follow you home I'll follow you, follow you home"
lyric,This hope is treacherous This daydream is dangerous This hope is treacherous
lyric,"I-I-I, I-I-I, I-I-I Two headlights shine through the sleepless night And I will get you, get you alone"
lyric,"Your name has echoed through my mind And I just think you should, think you should know That nothing safe is worth the drive"
lyric,"And I would follow you, follow you home I'll follow you, follow you home I'll follow you, follow you home"
lyric,"I'll follow you, follow you home This slope is treacherous I-I-I like it"
lyric,"Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago I was in your sights, you got me alone You found me, you found me, you found me"
lyric,"I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that And when I fell hard, you took a step back Without me, without me, without me"
lyric,And he's long gone when he's next to me And I realize the blame is on me Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
lyric,"So shame on me now Flew me to places I'd never been Til you put me down, oh"
lyric,I knew you were trouble when you walked in So shame on me now Flew me to places I'd never been
lyric,"Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground Oh, oh-oh Trouble, trouble, trouble"
lyric,"Oh, oh-oh Trouble, trouble, trouble No apologies, he'll never see you cry"
lyric,"Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street"
lyric,"A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be And now I see, now I see, now I see He was long gone when he met me"
lyric,"And I realize the joke is on me, hey I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Oh) So shame on me now"

lyric,"I haven't seen them in a while You've been good, busier than ever We small talk, work and the weather"
lyric,Your guard is up and I know why Because the last time you saw me Is still burned in the back of your mind
lyric,"You gave me roses, and I left them there to die So this is me swallowing my pride Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night"
lyric,And I go back to December all the time It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
lyric,"I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright I go back to December all the time These days, I haven't been sleeping"
lyric,"Staying up, playing back myself leaving When your birthday passed and I didn't call And I think about summer, all the beautiful times"
lyric,I watched you laughing from the passenger side and Realized I loved you in the fall And then the cold came
lyric,"The dark days when fear crept into my mind You gave me all your love, and all I gave you was goodbye So this is me swallowing my pride"
lyric,"Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night And I go back to December all the time It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you"

lyric,"I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile So good to me, so right And how you held me in your arms that September night"
lyric,The first time you ever saw me cry Maybe this is wishful thinking Probably mindless dreaming
lyric,"But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't So if the chain is on your door, I understand"
lyric,"But this is me swallowing my pride Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night And I go back to December"
lyric,"It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright"
lyric,"I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind I go back to December all the time All the time"
lyric,I am not the kind of girl Who should be rudely barging in On a white veil occasion
lyric,But you are not the kind of boy Who should be marrying the wrong girl I sneak in and see your friends
lyric,And her snotty little family All dressed in pastel And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
lyric,Somewhere back inside a room Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry This is surely not
